## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
Our idea is to build a Web-based AI Interview System that offers a real-life boardroom experience for both experts and candidates. The AI will dynamically generate questions based on the candidate's domain expertise and analyze responses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This will allow for automated evaluation and scoring of candidates based on multiple criteria such as relevance, correctness, and confidence. Additionally, the platform will provide a dashboard for experts to review responses and adjust scores, ensuring fair and transparent selection processes.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
**Our AI-based interview system will provide a seamless and immersive experience for both interviewers and candidates.

Key Features:

Candidate Dashboard: Secure login, profile setup, and resume upload.

AI-driven Interview Simulation: Real-time questioning and answer evaluation.

Speech-to-Text Integration: Automated transcription of candidate responses.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI evaluates responses based on relevance and correctness.

Scoring System: AI assigns scores based on question relevance, content quality, and speech clarity.

Interviewer Review Panel: Experts can provide additional feedback and adjust AI scores.

Comprehensive Reports: Candidates receive detailed performance insights.

Admin Controls: Manage applicants, interviewers, and question banks.**
